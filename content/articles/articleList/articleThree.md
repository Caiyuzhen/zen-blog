There is such a company, the corporate culture requires employees to talk into a clear, fact-based, flat, employee-owned decision-making, the use of 360 evaluation, globalization strategy, you think it is talking about byte-hopping bytefan? No, let's look at another set of data (around April 2021), with a market capitalization of over $250 billion, 209 million paying users worldwide, and $7.3 billion in revenue. This is exactly the father of Byte Fan, the forefather of recommendation algorithm, the progenitor of OTO, the grandfather of central warehouse, Netflix which pioneered the Internet membership subscription system.



I. The DVD Era -- 1997 - 2007
In the late 90's in the United States, if you wanted to watch a movie at home, you still had to go to a video rental store to rent a disc. Back then, you could walk down the street and someone would come up to you and ask you if you wanted a disc.

One day, Reed Hasting suddenly found that he had rented an Apollo 13 movie at PepsiCo because he had forgotten to return it for a long time, and the late fee actually cost him $40, which was simply to cut himself a knife. So Hasting got angry and picked up PepsiCo's financial report and found that 20% of its operating income came from late fees from users, similar to today's Feng nest delivery lockers, and sometimes the late fees even catch up with the delivery fees.

In order to regain the dignity of $40, Hastings created Netflix in 1997, positioned as a civilian DVD rental platform, woolgathering level of the price, compared to Blockbuster rent 5 nights to $9.99, Nifty only with $4.99 / month, and the use of two effective strategies:

01. Light asset model:
Netflix has established the earliest paid membership subscription system, and instead of opening offline rental stores and arranging sales staff, Netflix defines its role as an online rental service provider. The only cost is the cost of the central warehouse each month.


02. Membership Subscription Model:
Netflix has adopted an innovative membership subscription model, which means that users only need to pay a monthly fee to freely choose movies to watch, and also cuts out late fees and is completely ad-free, in fact, Netflix takes advantage of the habit of users not returning the discs on time, so that they can leave them at home and mail them back for replacement when they want to watch the next movie, somewhat similar to the early drinking fountains. This strategy also helped Netflix save a lot of money on storage costs.
Fork a word, today's use of membership system of some well-known enterprises such as retail Costco, online e-commerce Amazon, the social field of QQ members belong to this category, in a narrow sense we subscribe to figma is also equivalent to a membership in disguise

II. Streaming Media Platform Era - 2007 - 2013
01. A transformation:
By 2005, the bandwidth of the Internet was starting to support the level of video viewing, and the founding team of Netflix was keenly aware that the postal + DVD business model was an overkill business, and that what they were essentially doing was distributing content, and that the postal service was an inefficient way to distribute content with high latency, while the Internet was more efficient. Therefore, Netflix broke its own arm and shifted its business focus to online streaming service instead of its most lucrative DVD rental service, transforming into a streaming service company.

On the contrary, rival PepsiCo is still in the leasing + late payment model, although it also tried to transform online subscription services, but online services and the interests of more than 9,000 franchises conflict, tripping their own body, late payment is not cut off, the rejection is very serious, by 2010 declared bankruptcy, a huge thing has fallen.

III. Content self-production era -- 2013 - present
02. The second transition:
During the transition to streaming, Netflix had to pay $30 million a year in royalties to Starz, a US cable company, and when the contract expired in 2011, Srarz raised its asking price tenfold. Reid-Hastings thus realized that the next round of competition would be about content rights.
Netflix looked at the political struggles + Kevin Spacey numbers and realized that Americans still love political series and Spacey wasn't out of fashion yet, so they cut the deal and launched House of Cards in 2013. The show was released in a single episode and became an instant hit on the Internet.

Netflix's business model has also transformed from online release to: provide quality content → attract users to pay → increase stickiness → get more revenue to invest in content creation → provide more quality content, and keep snowballing, thus reaching its own growth flywheel. By 2018, its market value will surpass that of Disney, the oldest content company; by 2021, its current market value will be more than 200 billion yuan, more than 15 microblogs than You Aiteng combined.

1.  Netflix's user mindset:
Traditional media companies think in terms of traffic, that is, they try to attract as many people as possible and then sell ads, while Netflix's "super user mindset" treats itself as a 0-1 product that is constantly being iterated and polished to achieve its current success and pursue the maximum user experience.


04. Key touchpoints:
In the early stage of the business, Netflix did not invest heavily in advertising, but found one of the most critical touch points in the whole experience chain - the envelope for shipping discs. Netflix reinforced the brand perception of Netflix, and users can associate the brand with Netflix when they see the big red envelope on the street.

</div>

05. Heartstream status:
Prime, Disney's Hulu, and HBO all release one episode a week. Netflix, on the other hand, has started a strategy of updating a whole season at once, so that users will follow their own state of mind and keep watching one episode after another, immersing themselves in it, so that they have no chance to contact other competing products. Psychological research also proves that immersive viewing makes people more and more high, so Netflix is like a TV version of Tiktok.

06. The Cocktail Party Effect:
The cocktail party effect suggests that people tend to pay more attention to information that is relevant to them. Netflix introduced the "Cinematch" sorting algorithm back in 2002, more than a decade before Shake Shack and Headline, and this initiative has led to a 90% next-month renewal rate for subscribers. The algorithm helps Netflix to better understand user preferences and market trends, whether users watch dramas in the evening or at midnight, whether they like Villeneuve or Hitchcock, how long they watch each time, etc., which greatly improves user retention, so you can also say that Netflix is a company that essentially does search engine and big data algorithm mining.

07. Gamification mechanics:
It is human nature to play games, but for a long time video episodes have been put on the side to be watched, and people can not participate in them. In 2018 Netflix started an experiment of interactive drama, launching an experimental drama: "Black Mirror: Pandasnaki", applying gamification mechanics to TV series, where people's choices can influence the direction of the episodes, bringing a wave of interactive drama boom.

08. The Second Growth Curve:
Charles Handy, the founder of the "second curve" theory, has a saying in his book "The Second Curve": When you know where you should go, you often have no chance to go. Netflix has the spirit of constantly revolutionizing its own life to keep crossing borders, keep making disruptive innovations, keep figuring out its own second growth curve at every key point, and keep staying evergreen.

On the Netflix website you can see the founding team's definition of itself: "Netflix is a global streaming service entertainment company" whose competition is not NBC or gaming, but all users' after-work pastime.
