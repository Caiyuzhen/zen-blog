About creation tools

We think about what is information, what is a carrier of information, what is connection, what is knowledge, and how we see it on the level of individuals, organizations, companies and even the whole society and culture. As the Notion team says, we are only using new technologies to continue the thinking of our predecessors, not to create something unique from 0-1.


From an academic point of view, Shannon, the founder of information theory, believes that information is a third kind of matter, distinct from matter and energy, and that information is essentially data that reflects the properties of matter. Relatively there are carriers used to carry information, such as mud slabs, bamboo slips, paper, bits, etc. We all know that the human brain has 100 billion neurons, which is equivalent to about 7.8 billion terabytes of storage capacity, the human brain can also be seen as a carrier of information.

The traditional information medium is isolated, for example, Guangping is a carpenter, in his life's work will be recorded in a small book, the information is private, one day Guangping lost it is equivalent to this piece of information will disappear, Guangping's disciples have to learn from scratch again, so in that time of information scarcity, the ancient people to continue the information is very difficult.
